\begin{abstract}
  This research presents AGROAI, an intelligent system designed to detect and classify diseases in soybean crops using computer vision and deep learning techniques. The project addresses the critical need for timely and accurate disease identification in agriculture, which directly impacts crop yield and sustainability. The methodology integrates a large dataset of annotated soybean leaf images, representing seven common diseases and healthy leaves, and leverages Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for automated image classification. The system was trained and validated using a dataset split into 70\% for training, 15\% for validation, and 15\% for testing. The model achieved high accuracy in detecting diseases such as bacterial blight, Cercospora leaf spot, downy mildew, and others, demonstrating the effectiveness of Vision Transformers in agricultural contexts. The application generates early diagnoses and actionable recommendations to support farmers in making informed decisions. The results indicate that the proposed approach can significantly reduce diagnostic time and increase the reliability of disease detection, contributing to improved crop management and food security. Future work will focus on expanding the model's capabilities to other crops and integrating mobile deployment for real-time field usage.
